ðŸ’Ž Advanced Diamond Price Prediction

This project predicts the price of diamonds using machine learning. It uses data about each diamondâ€™s features, like carat, cut, color, and clarity, to estimate how much it is worth.

# Main Features

Data Cleaning: Fix missing values, remove outliers, and prepare data for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  : Create charts and graphs to understand the data and find important patterns.

Feature Engineering              : Make new useful features to improve prediction accuracy.

Machine Learning Models          : Train different models to find the best one for predicting prices:

- Linear Regression

- Ridge and Lasso Regression

- Decision Tree and Random Forest

- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)

Model Tuning: Use cross-validation and grid search to improve model performance.

Evaluation: Check how well the models predict prices using error metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²).

Clean Code: Well-organized scripts ready for further development or deployment.

# Tools Used
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost)

- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations

- Jupyter Notebook

# Goal
To build an accurate and easy-to-use tool that helps estimate diamond prices for jewelers, sellers, and buyers.
